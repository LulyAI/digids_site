      2. DigIdS grading API works best in combination with Phone Verification and/or E-Mail Verification during the new-user registration process. <p>
      3. DigIdS grading API shall also be added within the password reset process, the various sign-in entry points as well as any phone based or email based Authentication processes, i.e. before phone based Two Factor Authentication is triggered. <p>
      4. DigIdS grading API requires customization for each customer for optimal performance. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution. You will have a dedicated AI expert working with you on the roll-out and customization of your solution. <p>
